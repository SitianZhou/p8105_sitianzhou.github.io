Welcome to my website!

# About me

I'm Sitian Zhou, a first-year MS student at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I grew up in Zhejiang, China, and came to the US in 2019 for my undergraduate study at UC Davis with a major in biotechnology and a minor in statistics. After completing my Bachelor's degree, I came to Columbia University to pursue a Master's degree in biostatistics. You can find my [academic and professional experience](academic.html) here.
